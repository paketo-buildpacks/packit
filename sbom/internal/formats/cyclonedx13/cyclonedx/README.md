# Source
The contents of this directory is largely based on CycloneDX/cyclonedx-go's
internal `cyclonedx` package. The version copied is from tag version
[0.4.0](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-go/tree/dc02c3afeacc6975b83f6c579b2adfa19f85873f),
which [supports CycloneDX Spec version
1.3](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-go/blob/404f9a308e0f2cdf22e16fe9fda4d7cb6a5b19a2/README.md#compatibility).

Only the portions of the package that are strictly necessary for SBOM encoding
have been included here.
