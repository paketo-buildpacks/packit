The contents of this directory is largely based on anchore/syft's
internal `syftjson` package. The version copied is from an [old
commit](https://github.com/anchore/syft/tree/dfefd2ea4e9d44187b4f861bc202970247dd34c8)
of Syft that supports Syft JSON Schema 2.0.2.

The implementations of `decoder` and `validator` have been omitted for
simplicity, since they are not required for buildpacks' SBOM generation.
