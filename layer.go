	// during their build phase according to the specification:

	Launch bool

	// Cache indicates whether the layer is persisted and made available to

	// and

	// layer if suitable. The Metadata field ultimately fills the metadata field

	// The listed executables will be given a numerical prefix so that they will be executed in the slice order.
	// E.g. []string{"/helper", "/bin/command", "/${cnbPath}/other-process"} will result in:
	// - <layers>/${Name}/exec.d/0-helper
	// - <layers>/${Name}/exec.d/1-command
	// - <layers>/${Name}/exec.d/2-other-process
	// Do not forget to add these files to the `buildpack.toml` so they are available.
	// If enough executables are given, this function will pad the prefix with zeros so that they are in the correct
	// alphabetically ascending order.
	// E.g. []string{"/cmd0", ... , "/cmd10", ..., "/cmd100"} will result in:
	// - <layers>/${Name}/exec.d/000-cmd0
	// - <layers>/${Name}/exec.d/010-cmd10
	// - <layers>/${Name}/exec.d/100-cmd100
