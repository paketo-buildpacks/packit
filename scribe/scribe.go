// Package scribe provides a set of interfaces to allow buildpack authors to
// control their logs on varying levels of granularity. This exposes high level
// logging functions with packit specific business logic baked into the logging
// as well as low level functionality that allows an author to build up their
// own functionality using atomic pieces.
